The purpose of this is to enable Arch users to build the last official release of TrenchBroom 2023.1. since the current AUR version is broke, missing depends, etc.

To build TB in your Arch distro of choice from a terminal :

git clone https://github.com/eGax/arch-pkgbuild-trenchbroom.git
cd arch-pkgbuild-trenchbroom
